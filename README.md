# Algorithms-And-Problem-Solving-Level-2

🔢 Algorithms & Problem Solving – Level 2
Simple problems to strengthen logic & core programming fundamentals that i made a long ago (07/2024)

This repository contains a collection of very simple algorithmic problems solved as part of my Level 2 learning journey.
These exercises focus on building logic, structured thinking, and foundational programming skills, following the ProgrammingAdvices.com roadmap.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this level is to improve my ability to:

Think algorithmically

Break down problems into clear steps

Implement solutions using basic programming concepts

Strengthen the fundamentals needed before moving into more advanced topics


📘 What This Level Covers

This collection includes very simple yet essential problems that help reinforce:

✔️ Basic Algorithms

Selection (decision-making)

Simple loops

Basic mathematical operations

Elementary data manipulation

✔️ Foundational Concepts

Input & output handling

Conditions & branching

Simple functions

Clean and readable code practices

✔️ Logic Building

These problems are intentionally simple.
Their main purpose is to train the mind to think like a programmer.
    └── ...


Each file focuses on a single small problem so the logic is easy to understand and improve.

🛠️ Technologies Used

C++ (main language)

Basic standard library features

Simple functions and clean code structure
